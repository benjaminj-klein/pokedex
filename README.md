This is a Pokedex web app created with React, Bootstrap, ChartJS, and the PokeAPI. It features responsive cards to display the Pokemon on different sized screens, and when clicked, more details are shown, including animated bar graphs to show to the Pokemon's statistics. There is also a search bar which utilizes the useState hook to update search results dynamically. The site currently features the original 151 Pokemon, but I plan to keep working on this project to improve it, such as adding later generations of Pokemon, adding animated sprites where applicable, and further UI improvements. I started this project while attending the Nucamp Front-End Web Development Bootcamp.
